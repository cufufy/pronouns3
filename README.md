# Pronouns

Pronouns is a plugin that lets players set their pronouns. This was created for the Pride event in ClassiCraft, but is now open to the public for use. 

To set multiple pronouns, use one of two formats: "She/her;They/Them" or "She/They"

**Supports Minecraft 1.21.5+ (Paper).**

## THIS IS PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE

I assume absolutely no responsibility if this plugin breaks anything - use at your own risk.
