# Pronouns

This is a work-in-progress rewrite of my plugin [Pronouns](https://github.com/lucypoulton/pronouns).
Pronouns is a plugin that lets players set their pronouns, making their experience on the server that little bit more
personal.

**Supports Minecraft 1.21.5 (Paper, Velocity).**

## THIS IS PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE

I assume absolutely no responsibility if this plugin breaks anything - use at your own risk.

### Features

- **Individual Pronouns:** Players can set their pronouns to personalize their experience.
- **Multiple Pronoun Sets:** Players can define and use multiple sets of pronouns (e.g., she/her and they/them).
- **Custom Pronouns/Neopronouns:** Full support for player-defined custom pronouns with correct grammatical conjugation.
- **PlaceholderAPI Support:** Extensive PlaceholderAPI integration, allowing for grammatically correct sentence construction using player pronouns, including support for multiple and custom sets with indexed access.
- **Flexible Data Storage:** Options to store pronoun data, including MySQL for network-wide compatibility.
- **Developer API:** Extensible API for other plugins to interact with pronoun data.
- **Platform Support:** Currently supports Paper and Velocity. Sponge and BungeeCord support is planned.
