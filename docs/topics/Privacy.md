# Privacy

ProNouns collects a small amount of statistical information related to your server.

This data is collected under the terms of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

#### What data is collected?

Currently, the following information is collected from the plugin:
- A random identifier, unique to your server. This is always kept private and solely exists to prevent duplicated data.
- The version of the plugin you're using
- The type of pronoun store you're using
- The version of Minecraft your server software is using
- Which platform you're running the plugin on, for example Paper, Fabric or Sponge

#### How long is data stored for?

To help me analyse data, data is kept for no more than one year from time of collection.

#### Where is it obtained from?

This data is sent automatically by the plugin, when both the plugin is enabled and stats is enabled in the plugin 
configuration, to an HTTP endpoint <path>https://pronouns-stats.lucypoulton.net/v1 </path> every fifteen minutes.

#### Why is this data collected?

I collect this information for two reasons:
- To better understand how server administrators use certain features, in order to improve them
- To keep myself motivated! Knowing that people are using my work is a massive driving force for me.

Under the UK GDPR, the legal basis for collecting this information is that I have a legitimate interest.

#### What are my rights?

- **Your right of access** - You have the right to ask for copies of your personal information.

If if you have an issue with the data collected, or if you wish to exercise the above rights, please do get in contact!
I totally understand that data collection is something that people might not want.

#### Who is responsible for the collected data?

That would be me, Lucy Poulton.
I can be contacted:

#### How can I opt out?

You can opt out of data collection by adding 
```ini
stats=false
```
to your plugin configuration. This will entirely disable stats being sent for the plugin.
