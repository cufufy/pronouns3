# Boring nerdy grammar stuff

Time for an English lesson :D

ProNouns is much more useful if you understand what it's actually doing. This page aims to cover everything grammatical
that you need to know, starting with the absolute basics and building up.

This page doesn't touch on the gender-expression-related aspects of pronouns, just grammar.

## What is a pronoun?

pronoun
: (noun) a word that is used instead of a noun or a noun phrase.
    
    _Cambridge English Dictionary_

Let's look at a basic sentence, but without any pronouns.

_Lucy has spent the last three hours writing about grammar. Lucy is very tired and Lucy would love to go to bed._

It's awkward having to refer to our subject over and over again by name, 
so we drop in a pronoun to make the sentence flow better.

_Lucy has spent the last three hours writing about grammar. **She** is very tired and **she** would love to go to bed._


## Different pronouns for different places

Let's look at a slightly more complex example.

_**She** sounds really cool. I'd love to meet **her**._

Now we have two different pronouns for the same person - what's going on there? 
To understand this, we need to understand that there are three parts to every sentence:

- the **subject** - the person/animal/thing/etc carrying out an action
- the **verb** - what the subject is doing
- (sometimes) the **object** - what the subject is doing the thing to

We use different pronouns depending on if we're talking about the subject or the object.

- _**She** sounds really cool_ - we're referring to the subject, so we use the subjective pronoun
- _I'd love to meet **her**._ - we're referring to the object, so we use the objective pronoun

Here are all the types you need to care about: 

| Type                 | Description                                                               | Example                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Personal subjective  | Referring to the subject                                                  | **She** sounds really cool.        |
| Personal objective   | Referring to the object                                                   | I'd love to meet **her**.          |
| Possessive           | Indicates possession                                                      | This server is **hers**.           |
| Possessive adjective | Indicates possession (technically not a pronoun but it behaves similarly) | That's **her** car.                |
| Reflexive            | When the subject and the object are the same                              | She should be proud of **herself** |

There are more types of pronoun, but they're not relevant to us as they don't change depending on the person using them.

## Verbs and stuff

So far we've established that we can use pronouns to replace regular nouns or noun phrases, 
and they change depending on the context we use them.

So we could take the sentence _Lucy is very cool_

and drop in _**She** is very cool_

or _**They** is very cool_ - &nbsp;

-oh. "They is" doesn't quite seem right. To understand why, we need to talk about verb forms and conjugation.

Verbs come in many forms, but most start life in the **infinitive** form. This form usually starts with "to ",
for example "to have", "to be", "to go", etc. 

To make them usable in a sentence, we need to take them out of the infinitive - this is called **conjugation**.

As far as ProNouns is concerned (it has no use case for things like the first person so just ignores it),
there are two ways to conjugate a verb in any given tense:

- **singular** - traditionally used when referring to another individual i.e. she **has**, he **is**
- **plural** - traditionally used when referring to yourself or a group of people i.e. they **have**

The advent of singular they, along with some neopronouns, means that the words "singular" and "plural" don't carry much 
meaning anymore, but every set falls into one of those categories.
