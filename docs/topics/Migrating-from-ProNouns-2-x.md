# Migrating from ProNouns 2.x

If you're updating from ProNouns 2.x, you'll need to manually migrate your pronoun store. 
Fortunately this is a very simple process.



## Before you start

Make sure you've [set up your new pronoun store]](Stores.md) before migrating.

## Migrating
### If you were using MySQL
> Migration from a legacy MySQL store is not yet supported.

### If you were __not__ using MySQL
Run the command `/pronouns migrate yml`.
