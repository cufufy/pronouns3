# Setting your pronouns

To set your pronouns, you can use the `/pronouns set <pronouns>` command.
Generally speaking, you can put anything in here - it's pretty good at guessing what you mean. 

Here are the options:

- you can set a single set, for example `/pn set she` or `/pn set he/him`
- you can set multiple sets, for example `/pn set she/they` or `/pn set they he`
- you can use the special values `/pn set any` or `/pn set ask`
- you can use neopronouns - see below

## Neopronouns

The plugin supports using neopronouns - how you do it depends on the way the server you're playing on is configured.

1. First of all, try setting it normally as per the first example on the page.
2. If that doesn't work, you'll need to figure out what your pronouns are in [the plugin's format](Pronoun-set-format.md).
You can do this using [the tool on my website](https://lucypoulton.net/pn) - it'll give you a command to copy-paste.
